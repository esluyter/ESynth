# ESynth

Work in progress semi-modular SuperCollider synth with patching interface that will scale from monophonic to paraphonic to polyphonic.

Aiming for a framework that supports experimenting with / easily adding new modules.

Requires Connection quark and Houvilainen filter (https://github.com/esluyter/houvilainenfilter).
